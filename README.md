# Vida2Maespa
Tool for using Vida outputs to parameterize MAESPA

Vida2MAESPA is a tool for converting data from Vida simulations to parameterization for running MAESPA simulations.

Working:
     -Makes trees.dat and confile.dat based on Vida outputs

     -Makes phy and str files, but these are just copies of the templates

     -Output a points.dat file

     -Provides a key file for mapping MAESPA indexed output to VIDA tree UIDs

     -Argument parsing so you can easily define the file to process from the command line

To do:
     

     -Output a dxf based on the points.dat file
