# Vida2Maespa
Tool for using Vida outputs to parameterize MAESPA

Vida2MAESPA is a tool for converting data from Vida simulations to parameterization for running MAESPA simulations.

Working:
     -Makes trees.dat and confile.dat based on Vida outputs

     -Makes phy and str files, but these are just copies of the templates

To do:
     -Include argument parsing so you can easily define the file to process from the command line

     -Output a points.dat file

     -Output a dxf based on the points.dat file

     -Produce meaningful phy files
     
     -Produce meaningful str files
